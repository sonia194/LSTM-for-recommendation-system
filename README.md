# LSTM-for-recommendation-system
The main motivation of this project is to improve the model of CFRS on Amazon review performed with the LSTM-SA. The result of the SA can be visualized to perform opinion mining of customers on a particular product and try to build better business strategies. For this project, appropriate exploratory Data Analysis was carried out on the amazon cell phone and accessories dataset and sentence-level sentiment classification was performed on each and every review using LSTM-SA. I will a pre trained global vector (GloVe) and the LSTM model to predict the new score toward the reviews. After getting the results in the first step, I will integrate this in the RS based on the user-item collaborative filtering (CF) and evaluate the model based on the RMSE
